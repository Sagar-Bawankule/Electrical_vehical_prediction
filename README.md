# Electrical_vehical_prediction
This project uses historical vehicle registration data from the Washington State Department of Licensing to forecast the future adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The goal is to build a regression or time series model that helps urban planners and policymakers anticipate the growth of EVs and plan charging infrastructure accordingly.

By understanding monthly EV adoption trends at the state and county levels, this project enables data-driven decisions for sustainable transportation planning.

üéØ Objectives
Forecast EV adoption for the next 12‚Äì24 months

Analyze trends in BEV and PHEV adoption

Visualize county-level and statewide EV growth

Support charging infrastructure planning with predictive insights
